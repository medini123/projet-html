            <p>The basic principles of sports nutrition 
                Sports nutrition consists of three basic principles. But how they look for each person may be completely different to the next, depending on the goal of the sport. The three principles are:
                
                Fuelling - providing the body with food to enhance stamina, strength and clarity.
                Hydration - preventing dehydration and fatigue, whilst optimising muscle performance. 
                Recovery - to aid in recovery after exercise. 
                How can we put this into practice?
                Sports nutrition isn’t just reserved for elite athletes and marathon runners. Anyone keen to understand and elevate their fitness can benefit from sports nutrition.
                
                Hydration and fuelling strategies vary depending on the type of event you are participating in, so, using the key principles, let’s take a look at what sports nutrition might look like for the average gym-goer and a marathon runner...
                
                The average gym-goer
                For the average gym-goer, fuelling might consist of a 'typical' healthy diet'. For example:
                
                50% carbohydrates
                30% fat
                20% protein
                five-plus pieces of fruit and vegetables a day
                Hydration is also important, aiming for at least two litres of fluid per day. It is advised to have a high carbohydrate snack an hour or so before the session such as two slices of wholemeal toast, particularly if you haven’t eaten for over three hours. 
                
                After the workout, aim to have a full meal (usually lunch or dinner) within two hours, containing a mix of carbohydrates and protein to help the body recover. The carbohydrate will restock spent energy stores (glycogen) and the protein will help repair damaged muscle fibres. 
                
                Elite marathon runner
                For an elite marathon runner, the principles of sports nutrition change slightly. You’d need to eat more calories in general, as you'll be training more often and potentially at a higher intensity. You need to have a higher carbohydrate intake to increase carbohydrate stores (glycogen) to have more available energy.
                
                So, your diet might look like this:
                
                65% carbohydrate
                20% fat
                15% protein
                You’d need to take in more fluids to avoid muscle fatigue and increased injury risk, as you risk losing more fluids through sweat.
                
                Finally, recovery strategies would be even more important for a marathon runner, as training more means there would be less time between sessions, meaning less time to recover. This would mean having a carbohydrate/protein-rich snack within 30 minutes of finishing a training session, such as a banana with a protein shake.

    <p>How it Works:

        As a Clinical Nutritionist I will identify possible nutritional imbalances which may contribute to sub optimal health. This is often achieved via biochemical testing, taking any guess work out of the equation. I will assess you holistically and look at various lifestyle factors that could be impacting your health. The aim is to address these imbalances by developing a personalised nutrition, lifestyle and possible supplement plan, that fits into your daily life. This is where my grounded approach really works, as I will work together with you and will give help and advice that is achievable and don't suddenly expect you to make dramatic changes to your diet/lifestyle.
        
        The Consultation Process:
        
        You complete a very detailed health questionnaire and food diary prior to our initial consultation. This gives you the opportunity to share with me relevant information regarding your goal, health issues and symptoms. This should be sent back to me at least 48 hours prior to our consultation.
        Prior to the initial consultation, I analyse the questionnaire and carry out all relevant research needed.
        During the initial 90 minute consultation, I will discuss the questionaire, asking you relevant questions, to really get to know your symptoms. I will explain what I think is happening and then together a personalised nutrition and lifestyle plan will be devised, to help achieve your goal. Biochemical testing may also be advised, for example, I might suggest to a client with compromised digestion to have a comprehensive stool analysis test to detect levels of good and bad bacteria in the gut. I use various laboratories around the UK, but all tests are carried out at your own home and then posted to the lab. Supplements can also be recommended if needed.
        After the consultation I will forward you a Health Optimisation plan (HOP). This will outline all the steps we have agreed upon, to improve your health in a simple, easy to understand format.
        A follow up session is usually advised, usually 4-6 weeks later to review and adapt the HOP. A new and updated version will be sent to you after this session.</p>
